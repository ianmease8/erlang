# Overview

I wanted to learn a new language and learning a functional programming language at that. This project was used to get me familiar with the language and test out a cool mathmatical theory.


This software looks to showcase the theory of benfords law, which is essentially the theory that the leading digit is most likely going to be a smaller digit than a bigger one, ie 1 will be apparent more than a 9 will be. To do this I got 4 data sets, the fibonacci sequence up to 1000 numbers, a list of 1000 randomly generated digits, as well as iranian 2009 presidential election numbers and american 2008 presidential election numbers.The iranian data was sourced from https://github.com/midnightradio/cse140-data-programming and the american data was sourced from the same link as well  https://github.com/midnightradio/cse140-data-programming 


My purpose in writing this software was to get a better understanding of the syntax of other langauges and how to write functioning code in that langauge

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used erlang shell 
and a erlang language extensions for visual studio code
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
Erlang was the language of choice for this project

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to include more data sets
* I would like to make this a threaded program
* It might be nice to include more information on the concept of benfords law
